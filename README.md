Performing Analysis on stock market data with Excel VBA

## Project Overview
The goal of the stock analysis project was to refactor Excel VBA code on a collection of twelve stocks in order to determine if they are profitable or non-profitable investments. This analysis was originally completed in a similar syntax, however, the primary objective for this challenge activity was to improve the efficiency of the code (decrease the run time for the macro functions). The data used for this analysis included information on hundreds of different stocks including the ticker indicator, stock volume, stock issuance date, opening/closing prices, highest/lowest prices, and stock volume for the years of 2017 and 2018. The charts included for this project show the aformentioned stock information for twelve stocks. The created code retrieves the ticker indicator, the stock volume, and the return for each of the twelve selected stocks. 

## Results

The purpose of refactoring code is to modify existing code (ie. changing the factoring) in order improve its implementation without changing its external behavior.

For example, here are some snippets of the refactored code along with run time pop-ups showing the refactored codes improved functionality:
