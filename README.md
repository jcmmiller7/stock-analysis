Performing Analysis on stock market data with Excel VBA

## Project Overview
The goal of the stock analysis project was to refactor Excel VBA code on a collection of twelve stocks in order to determine if they are profitable or non-profitable investments. This analysis was originally completed in a similar syntax, however, the primary objective for this challenge activity was to improve the efficiency of the code (decrease the run time for the macro functions). The data used for this analysis included information on hundreds of different stocks including the ticker indicator, stock volume, stock issuance date, opening/closing prices, highest/lowest prices, and stock volume for the years of 2017 and 2018. The charts included for this project show the aforementioned stock information for twelve stocks. The created code retrieves the ticker indicator, the stock volume, and the return for each of the twelve selected stocks. 

## Results

The purpose of refactoring code is to modify existing code (ie. changing the factoring) in order improve its implementation without changing its external behavior.

For example, here are some snippets of the refactored code along with run time pop-ups showing the refactored codes improved functionality:

## Summary
The refactoring process has several key advantages. These include software design improvements, improved understanding/readability of the code, debugging, and helps programs produce output faster. However, there are some risks associated with refactoring code. Some disadvantages include that the refactoring process can be risky when working with large applications and it is also risky when the existing code does not have proper test cases. It is essential to refactor code when working with long-term software, but this process is often costly and time consuming which must be considered in the cost benefit analysis for the company. 

The main advantage for this specific VBA script are the decrease in the macro run time. The screenshots indicate that the refactored code runs approximately 0.5 seconds faster compared to the original code. The main disadvantage as it pertains to the stock analysis project was the time and effort put into refactoring the code to allow it to run only slightly faster. This would be more useful for larger programs that have much longer run times.
